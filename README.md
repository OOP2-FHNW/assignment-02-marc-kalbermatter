# Assignment 02

## Goals
- Complete the functions in `TransactionList` using `Streams`
- Make all tests in `TransactionListTest` succeed
- Try to write clean and understandable code
- Please keep the existing `.gitignore` in the repository, to not commit unnecessary things.

## Notes
You have given an already complete implementation of the classes:
 - `Trader`
 - `TransactionList`
 
 So there is no need to touch those!
